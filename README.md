# readline-vim [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thlorenz/readline-vim.png)](http://next.travis-ci.org/thlorenz/readline-vim)

Adds vim bindings to nodejs readline.

## Installation

    npm install readline-vim

## Usage

**Repl Example:**
```js
var rlv = require('readline-vim')
  , repl = require('repl');

var r = repl.start({
    prompt: "vim repl > ",
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
  });

// pass the readline component of the repl in order to add vim bindings to it
var vim = rlv(r.rli)
  , map = vim.map;

// Add mappings

// [insert mode] allow switching to normal mode by typing 'jk' quickly 
map.insert('jk', 'esc');

// [insert mode] go backward in history via 'ctrl-k' 
map.insert('ctrl-k', 'ctrl-p');

// [insert mode] go backward in history via 'ctrl-k' 
map.insert('ctrl-space', 'ctrl-n');

// [normal mode] go backward in history via space bar
map.normal('space', 'k');

// [normal mode] go forward in history via space bar when ctrl is pressed 
map.normal('ctrl-space', 'j');
```

Run it via: `npm run demo`

## Vim Bindings

A subset of vim keybindings is supported by `readline-vim`:

### Insert Mode

- `Esc`, `Ctrl-[`: normal mode

### Normal Mode

- `i`, `I`, `a`, `A`: insert mode with the expected side effects

#### Movements

- `h` cursor left
- `l` cursor right
- `w` word right
- `b` word left
- `0` beginning of line
- `$` end of line
- `f`, `F`, `t`, `T` followed by letter moves cursor to or up to the given letter

#### Movements combined with Actions

- `cb`: change word left
- `cw`: change word right
- `ch`: change left
- `cl`: change right
- `cc`: change line
- `C` : change line right

- `db`: delete word left
- `dw`: delete word right
- `dh`: delete left
- `dl`: delete right
- `dd`: delete line
- `D` : delete line right

- `x` delete right
- `X` delete left

#### Replacement

- `r` followed by letter replaces letter under the cursor with the given letter (i.e. `rx`)

#### History

- `k` go back in history
- `j` go forward in history

## Mappings

### Immediate Mappings

Immediate mappings execute immediately whe a key (possibly with modifiers) is pressed.

They can be applied in insert and normal mode.

Assuming we defined `vim` and `map` as outlined in the [usage examle](#usage).

```js
// emit [esc] when [ctrl-space] is pressed to switch to normal mode
map.insert('ctrl-space', 'esc');

// emit [k] when [space] is pressed to go backward in history
map.normal('space', 'k');
```

### Sequence Mappings

Sequence mappings are a number of keys **without modifiers** pressed quickly after another.

They can be applied to **insert mode only**.

Assuming we defined `vim` and `map` as outlined in the [usage examle](#usage).

```js
// map [jk] pressed in quick succession to [esc] to switch to normal mode
map.insert('jk', 'esc');
```

The interval allowed between keys in order to count as a sequence can be configured by setting `vim.threshold`, the
default is `200 milliseconds`.

### Inspecting Mappings

You can inspect your mappings by navigating/printing the `vim.map.mappings` object.

## Events

The following events are emitted to allow reacting to state changes:

- `normal` when mode changes to normal
- `insert` when mode changes to insert
- `write` when a key is written to the underlying `readline` (i.e. it wasn't handled by `readline-vim` and therefore
  passed through

These events are exposed via `vim.events`, so to subscribe to normal mode changes you would do:

```js
vim.events.on('normal', function () {
  // do something here to react
});
```

## Forcing the Readline into a Mode

You can cause the `readline` to change to a particular mode and pass a `Boolean` to indicate if that mode change should
be kept a secret (i.e. no event is emitted).

```js
vim.forceInsert();      // changes mode to insert and emits 'insert' event
vim.forceNormal(true);  // changes mode to normal, but emits no event
```
